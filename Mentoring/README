these are programs written for dr. tomai's computer science i class. thus i try to simplify the code as much as possible to where students can understand it in their current module - no complex data structures or algorithms. if it the code is more complex than it should be for CS I, then i am probably in the middle of the re-working it from my level of understanding. 

this constrait makes my code more lengthy/verbose but the challenge is fun.
