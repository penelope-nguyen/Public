these are programs written for dr. tomai's computer science i class. therefore i try to simplify the code as much as possible so that students may understand it in their current module - no complex data structures or algorithms. if the code is more complex than it should be for CS I, then i am probably in the middle of the re-working it from my level of understanding. 

this constraint makes my code more lengthy/verbose, but the challenge is fun.
